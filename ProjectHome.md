This extension provides a context menu for text selection.
Options include:
**Search google blogs** Search google site
**Add event to Google Calendar** Search google maps
**Translate** Define
**Note on Facebook** Share on Twitter

The option for Search google site is admittedly redundant (Chrome's context menu already has this), but I've left it for the time being.

To use this extension, just install it and select text with your cursor.  A menu will display at your cursor and allow you to choose one of the above mentioned links.  The menu will auto-hide, but there is also a close link.
